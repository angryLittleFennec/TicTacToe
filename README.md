# TicTacToe
Java console 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game  
  
Implemented different types of players: HumanPlayer (you choose which move to make), SequentialPlayer (fills the field up-to-down, left-to-right), RandomPlayer (makes random moves), CheatingPlayer (not the most honest player :) ).  
  
You can manage players in Main.java
