# TicTacToe (MNK)
Java console 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game (mod MNK)
  
Implemented different types of players: HumanPlayer (you choose which move to make), SequentialPlayer (fills the field up-to-down, left-to-right), RandomPlayer (makes random moves), CheatingPlayer (not the most honest player :) ).  
  
Now you can choose the size of your field, the number of X/O to win and the players!
